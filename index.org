* Abstract
This document provides some recommendations for efficiently writing finance papers using LaTeX and related tools, based on techniques that have made me (at least slightly) more productive over the years. It also contains the LaTeX style files and  BibTeX format files (along with sample paper outlines) necessary for making your paper and bibliography match the formats required by the /Journal of Finance/, /Journal of Financial Economics/, and /Review of Financial Studies/. The source file, *texintro.tex*, and various additional included files are important parts of this document.

This page was created using [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]] in [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]]. org-mode is an extremely useful package, which can do almost everything from keeping track of your To Do list and notes to writing papers to editing web pages.

* Acknowledgments
I am grateful to Jennifer Carpenter and Johan Walden for helpful suggestions and valuable input (even if some of it was inadvertent). I am also grateful to Tobias Oetiker for writing the *example* environment, which I use liberally in this document, and to Stefan Vollmar, whose formatting I borrowed with only minor changes for this Web page.
